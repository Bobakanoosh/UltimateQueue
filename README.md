Adds a plethora of additional features to server queue for players with permission. This plugin aims to move the various queue plugins all into one singular queue plugin, and allow easy configuration of which players have access to each feature. These features include:
* Queue Capacity
* New players skip queue
* Skip queues
* Skip the queue if they recently disconnected
* Players with certain auth level skip queue no matter what


# [#](#Permissions) Permissions
All permissions are customizable in the config files. You may use the default plugin permissions, or use permissions provided by other plugins.
